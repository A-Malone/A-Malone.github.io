<p>My name is Aidan Malone, and I am an unapologetic computer enthusiast and avid programmer. I'm currently studying Engineering Science at the University of Toronto with the intention of specializing into either the electrical and computer or robotics options. Outside of the classroom I'm always looking to master new skills and expand my horizons, from Ultimate Frisbee to blacksmithing.</p>

<p>I started getting into the Hackathon scene in first year and so far I've had a blast. I just finished my summer term ILead at UofT working on the Team-Effectiveness Learning System, an online system designed to encourage the development of team skills in undergraduate students. I'm hoping to apply the knowledge of databases, optimization, and web development I`ve gained at more hackathons over the course of the coming year.</p>
