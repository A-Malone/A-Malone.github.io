<p>I am an unapologetic computer enthusiast and avid programmer. Currently, I'm on a 16 month internship at Intel, following which I'll return to my studies in the robotics option of Engineering Science at the University of Toronto. Outside of the classroom I'm always looking to master new skills and expand my horizons, from Ultimate Frisbee to blacksmithing.<p>

<p>Two years ago I started getting into the Hackathon scene and so far I've had a blast. I spent my first summer term with ILead at UofT, scaling up the Team-Effectiveness Learning System to handle tens of thousands of students. Last year, I applied the knowledge of algorithms, databases, and web development I gained from my summer term and self-study of computer science on MIT OpenCoursware at more Hackathons and Competitions, placing in the top four at Capital One's data mining cup. It's been a great experience, and I'm looking forward to continuing on this path over the course of the coming year.</p>
