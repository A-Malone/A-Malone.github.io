I am an unapologetic computer enthusiast and avid programmer. Currently, I'm studying Engineering Science at the University of Toronto with the intention of specializing into either the ECE or robotics option. Outside of the classroom I'm always master new skills and expand my horizons, from Ultimate Frisbee to blacksmithing.

Last year I started getting into the Hackathon scene and so far I've had a blast. I just finished my summer term ILead at UofT, scaling up the Team-Effectiveness Learning System to handle tens of thousands of students. I'm hoping to apply the knowledge of databases and web development I`ve gained at more Hackathons over the course of the coming year.
