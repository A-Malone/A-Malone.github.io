Biomedical Engineering Competition 2014
====

This February I had the opportunity to compete in the CUBE biomedical engineering competition, in which undergraduate students were given 4 hours to come up with a solution to the problem of automating the process of distributing a sample into wells for testing. The goal of the competition was to make it easier for labs in resource poor environments to administer an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), a common test used to detect HIV. As such, the system had to be fast, accurate, and reusable. My team's entry, which won second place, is pictured below.

In designing our solution, we prioritized the accuracy and precision of the dispensing in order to ensure that there was no cross-contamination between samples. This was accomplished through the extensive use of rubber joiners and gears, resulting in a smooth and even distribution of the sample across the targeted wells. This accuracy was what won us second place.
